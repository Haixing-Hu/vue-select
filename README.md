# Component Properties

## `options`

The array of options of the selection control. It could be

- an array of strings, e.g., `['opt1', 'opt2']`; or
- an array of objects specifying the text and value of each option, e.g.,
  `[{text: 'name1', value: 'val1'}, {text: 'name2', value: 'val2'}]`; or
- an array of objects specifying the option group, e.g.
  ```
  [{
    label: 'group1',
    options: [{text: 'name1', value: 'val1'}, {text: 'name2', value: 'val2'}]
  }, {
    label: 'group2',
    options: [{text: 'name3', value: 'val3'}, {text: 'name4', value: 'val4'}]
  }]
  ```

## `model`

The model bind to the control, which must be a two way binding variable.

Note that the value of model could be set to `null`, and in that case the
selection will be set to nothing. Also, if the selection is set to nothing
(that is, the user delete the text in the input box of the selector), the
value of the model will be set to `null` instead of an empty string.

## `searchable`

The optional flag indicates whether to show the search box. The default value is
false.

## `multiple`

The optional flag indicates whether to use a multiple select control. The default
value is false.

## `language`

The optional code of language used by the
[select2](https://github.com/select2/select2) plugin.

The supported languages are exactly the same as the supported languages of the
[select2](https://github.com/select2/select2) plugin. In order to use the
supported language, you must also include the corresponding "i18n" js file of
the [select2](https://github.com/select2/select2) plugin in your HTML file.

Note that the language code passed to this property could be a locale code
consists of a language code and a country code, e.g., `"en-US"`. The component
will automatically convert the locale code to the language code supported by
the [select2](https://github.com/select2/select2) plugin. Since some languages
have different variants in different country or region, e.g., `"zh-CN"` for the
simplified Chinese and `"zh-TW"` for the traditional Chinese, it's recommended
to use the locale code in the form of `"[language]-[country]"`.

If this property is not set, and the [vue-i18n](https://github.com/Haixing-Hu/vue-i18n)
plugin is used, the component will use the language code `$language` provided
by the [vue-i18n](https://github.com/Haixing-Hu/vue-i18n) plugin; otherwise, the
component will use the default value `"en-US"`.

## `theme`

The optional name of the theme of the [select2](https://github.com/select2/select2)
plugin. Default value is `'bootstrap'`.

Note that in order to use the bootstrap theme, you must include the CSS file
from the [select2-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/select2/select2-bootstrap-theme/) project.
And it's very important that the above CSS file must be included AFTER the
CSS file of the bootstrap.

The following is the correct order for including CSS files:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://cdn.bootcss.com/select2/4.0.0/css/select2.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://cdn.bootcss.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://select2.github.io/select2-bootstrap-theme/css/select2-bootstrap.css">
```

Check the [demo page](http://haixing-hu.github.io/vue-select/demo.html) for details.

## `name`

The optional name of the selection control.

# API

## `control`

This property is a reference to the JQuery selection of the base select
control. It could be used to call the APIs of
[select2](https://github.com/select2/select2) plugin. For example,
`select.control.val(val)` will set the value of the select to the
specified value, where `select` is the reference to the `vue-select`
component.
